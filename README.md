Git is a version control software

## Github

Github is a web service that you can make an account on and do stuff which has version control on them, basically it's a social network for projects that are managed through git. Anything that you change in your files can be seen and the history of it by clicking history which tells you what was added, removed, changed, etc.

## Repo
A repo is a github repository, and you can choose to make it public or private. You can also include a read me which you can write in and it tells the reader/viewer what they are in for, like the read me im doing now.

## Commit
Commit is essentially a save for your file, and in every commit it had a note associated with it and it's helpful for when you are doing things like collaborating with another person to tell them the changes made, for what reason, etc. Commit allows for Github to show you your history and each commit has a unique identifier for it.
